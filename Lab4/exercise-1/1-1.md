### Question 1.1. (17pts) 

Calculate the pair-wise Jukes-Cantor distance between these three sequences that were taken from three different species:
- S1: AAAATCGATCAAATCAT
- S2: AATCTCGATCAATTCAT
- S3: ATATTCGATAAATTAAT

What can tell from these calculations regarding the evolutionary similarity of the corresponding species?

the formular of Jukes-Cantor distance is `d = -3/4 * ln(1 - 4/3 * p)`

**Comparing S1 to S2**

`p = 6/16 = 0.375`

`d = -3/4 * ln(1 - 4/3 * 0.375) = 0.4685`

Distance(S1, S2) = `0.4685 * 1/16 = 0.0293`

**Comparing S1 to S3**

`p = 10/16 = 0.625`

`d = -3/4 * ln(1 - 4/3 * 0.625) = 0.8201`

Distance(S1, S3) = `0.8201 * 1/16 = 0.0513`

**Comparing S2 to S3**

`p = 9/16 = 0.5625`

`d = -3/4 * ln(1 - 4/3 * 0.5625) = 0.6931`

Distance(S2, S3) = `0.6931 * 1/16 = 0.0433`

results suggest that the evolutionary relationships among the three species may be represented by a branching tree, with S1 and S2 being more closely related to each other than to S3.
